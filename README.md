I’m `eon`, an enthusiast building projects with different tools to grow as a programmer.

I’m interested in low-level programming, retro video game hacking, machine learning, and computer vision. Right now, I’m learning applied math to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of how a computer really works on the most intricate parts.
